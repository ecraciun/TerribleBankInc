**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Things I'm thinking of including for the showcase
- [x] robots.txt
- [ ] hsts
- [ ] csp
- [ ] referrer policy
- [ ] feature policy
- [ ] x-frame-options
- [ ] x-xss-protection
- [ ] x-content-type-options
- [ ] server / framework headers
- [ ] sri
- [ ] password storage
- [ ] exceptions
- [ ] logs
- [ ] swagger
- [ ] injections
- [ ] xss
- [ ] csrf / xsrf
- [ ] insecure direct object references
- [ ] mass assignment risk
- [x] security.txt (https://securitytxt.org/)

Should be way more than enough.

## Functionals features I'm thinking of including
- [x] login / register / logout / forgot password / change password
- [x] view/edit profile info
- [x] view & manage accounts: list, create, block
- [ ] transfers: send to, history with search

I believe this should suffice for now.
